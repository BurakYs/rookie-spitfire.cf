        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>Last updated: 19.05.2023</p>

            Discord bot and website (the "Service") operated by Rookie Spitfire ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
        <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.
            These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the Service.</p>
        <p>Our Service is a Discord bot named "Rookie Spitfire".</p>
        <p>You agree to be bound by these Terms by accessing or using the Service. If you disagree with any part of the
            terms, you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>
        <h2>Links To Other Web Sites</h2>
        <p>The Service may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by us. We
            have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any
            third-party websites or services. You acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable,
            directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the
            use of or reliance on any such content, goods, or services available on or through any such websites or
            services.</p>
        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or
            liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. Upon
            termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. All provisions of the Terms which by
            their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership
            provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>
        <h2>Exclusions</h2>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of
            liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you.</p>
        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time without prior
            notice. By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be
            bound by the updated terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.</p>
